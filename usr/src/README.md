# App Directory

This is where you can put your source code. I've created a unnecessary abstraction layer just to show case how you can build your app like you would normally do.

# Example

```
ğŸ“¦src
 â”£ ğŸ“‚utils
 â”ƒ â”— ğŸ“œstatus_code.py
 â”£ ğŸ“œREADME.md
 â”£ ğŸ“œconstants.py
 â”— ğŸ“œmain.py
 ```
